## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        ## @x: a square invertible matrix
        ## return: a list containing functions to
        ##              1. set the matrix
        ##              2. get the matrix
        ##              3. set the inverse
        ##              4. get the inverse
        ##         this list is used as the input to cacheSolve()
        
        ## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
        
        inv <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                # use `<<-` to assign a value to an object in an environment 
                # different from the current environment. 
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
        getinv <- function() inv
        list(set=set, get=get, setinv=setinv, getinv=getinv)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## @x: output of makeCacheMatrix()
        ## return: inverse of the original matrix input to makeCacheMatrix()
        
        inv <- x$getinv()
        
        # if the inverse has already been calculated
        if (!is.null(inv)){
                # get it from the cache and skips the computation. 
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        
        # otherwise, calculates the inverse 
        mat <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(mat, ...)
        
        # sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.
        x$setinv(inv)
        
        return(inv)
}
